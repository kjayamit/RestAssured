# Rest-Assured Basic Example
This project was created to start the initial steps with test automation for a REST API using Rest-Assured. It tests the API: https://reqres.in/

# Required software
Java JDK 11+
Maven installed and in your classpath

# How to execute the tests
You can open each test class on src\test\java and execute all of them, but I recommend you run it by the command line: mvn test
